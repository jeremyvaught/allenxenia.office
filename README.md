# Allen Xenia Office

A new ASP.NET Core MVC application for Allen Building. This repository is a ground-up implementation of the agreed PRD; the previous application is reference material, not its source tree.

## Development

Requires .NET SDK 10.0.401 (or an allowed servicing patch). SQLite is the local database; production uses the existing Forge MySQL database with dedicated application credentials. MySQL-specific behavior is verified against a real isolated MySQL instance before release.

```sh
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build
dotnet run --project src/AllenBuilding.Web
```

The initial scaffold has no tenant data, configured providers or production readiness. Feature milestones add their setup instructions and verification evidence. Never use real tenants or payments in test fixtures.

## Architecture and authority

Domain contains business rules without framework/provider dependencies. Application holds shared authorized use cases. Infrastructure implements EF/Identity and external adapters. Web composes them and renders MVC views. Pages, APIs and the later assistant use the same application rules.

Canonical editable documentation lives in the owner's vault:

- [PRD](/Users/jeremyvaught/markdown/dotnet/Development/allen-xenia-office-prd-v2.md)
- [Technical specification](/Users/jeremyvaught/markdown/dotnet/Development/allen-xenia-office-technical-spec-v2.md)
- [Project brief](/Users/jeremyvaught/markdown/dotnet/Development/allen-xenia-office-project-brief.md)

These absolute links are local references, not files supplied by a public clone. This README supplies reproducible repository instructions. Planned features are not represented as delivered.

## Commit and release discipline

Commit each coherent, verified increment: foundation, domain rules, persistence/migrations, account flows, complete maintenance workflows, billing, reports, assistant and operational recovery. A milestone includes relevant checks and a descriptive message. Preserve the history; do not combine the rebuild into one final commit. Publication/deployment require their own evidence.
